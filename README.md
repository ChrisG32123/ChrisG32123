## Hi there üëã

My name is Chris, and I'm a PhD student in the Computational Mathematics, Science, & Engineering Department at Michigan State University. Welcome to my GitHub!

I have quite a few academic interests. However, my background is in applied mathematics, particularly in computational plasma physics. Check out my 1DNumericalPDE repository for that work. I have since transitioned to biomedical engineering focusing on developing predictive models and longitudinal algorithms in medical imaging (found in the Longitudinal-Data-Algorithm-Development repository). 

Additionally, I have other projects, some from personal passion and others from classes past. The stock-market-analysis repository began as my attempt to find low-rank representations of stock market time series data but quickly turned into an exercise in high performance paralllel computing using C++. The choice_week_sorting_hat repository is based off of solving a logistics problem between allocating students to classes, a problem my former employer (a K-8 school) had to manage manually. Finally, the beaconrunner-CAMCOS repository houses the first project I contributed to, a virtual simulation of various actors using a decentralized blockchain--intended to understand the Ethereum transaction system and its potential faults.

Over the course of Fall 2024, I intend to 'properly' organize and document most of my projects into GitHub--the way that software engineers are expected too.

# Adaptation of CV-Boilerplate

To run:
- `conda activate PersonalEnv`
- If output.pdf already exists: `make clean`
- `make` to run makefile

Metadata is stored in `details.yml`
LaTeX template is stored in `template.tex`
Directions for pdf construction are stored in `makefile`
Resume is stored in `output.pdf`

# CV Boilerplate

A boilerplate to ease the pain of building and maintaining a CV or r√©sum√© using LaTeX.

## Intro

The separation of content from presentation is considered a universal best practice. The typical content of a CV is a perfect fit for a YAML file due to its structured nature:

```YAML
---
name: Friedrich Nietzsche
address:
- Humboldtstra√üe 36
- 99425 Weimar
- Prussia
email: friedrich@thevoid.de
# ...
experience:
- years: 1879--1889
  employer: Freiberufler
  job: Freier Philosoph
  city: Sils-Maria
- years: 1869‚Äì-1879
  employer: Universit√§t Basel
  job: Professor f√ºr klassische Philologie
  city: Basel
```

That makes super easy to update a CV while keeping a consistent structure.

Thanks to [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/), we can then access our data from `template.tex` using a special notation. Iterating on repetitive data structures becomes trivial:

```latex
$for(experience)$
  $experience.years$\\
  \textsc{$experience.employer$}\\
  \emph{$experience.job$}\\
  $experience.city$\\[.2cm]
$endfor$
```

LaTeX takes then care of the typesetting with its usual elegance. Below a preview of the final result. Check out the [output](output.pdf) to see the compiled PDF.

With this method, you can keep your entire CV encoded in a single YAML file, put it under version control (into a gist, for instance), and generate a PDF on the fly when needed. You can also easily export it to other formats, like HTML for web publishing (I've heard [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) likes YAML). Convenient, portable and time-proof.

## Dependencies

1. LaTeX with the following extra packages: `fontspec` `geometry` `multicol` `xunicode` `xltxtra` `marginnote` `sectsty` `ulem` `hyperref` `polyglossia`
2. [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/), the universal document converter.

I highly recommend [TinyTeX](https://yihui.org/tinytex/) as LaTeX distribution. All additional packages can be installed with `tlmgr` as needed.

## Getting started

1. Fill `details.yml` with your personal details, work experience, education, and desired settings.
2. Run `make` to compile the PDF.
3. Tweak on `template.tex` until you're satisfied with the result.

**Note**: this template needs to be compiled with XeTeX.

### Note for Windows users

Although I didn't test it, you can probably use this on Windows, too. Both [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/installing.html) and LaTeX can be installed on Windows and you should be able to run makefiles on Windows through [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/). If that's too much hassle, this command should do the trick in Powershell:

    pandoc details.yml -o output.pdf --template=template.tex --pdf-engine=xelatex

## Available settings

- **`mainfont`**: Hoefler Text is the default, but every font installed on your system should work out of the box thanks to XeTeX.
- **`fontsize`**: Possible values here are 10pt, 11pt and 12pt.
- **`lang`**: Sets the main language through the `polyglossia` package. This is important for proper hyphenation, among other things.
- **`geometry`**: A string that sets the margins through `geometry`. Read [this](https://www.sharelatex.com/learn/Page_size_and_margins) to learn how this package works.
