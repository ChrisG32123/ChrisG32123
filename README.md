## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Chris, and I'm a PhD student in the Computational Mathematics, Science, & Engineering Department at Michigan State University. Welcome to my Github!

I have quite a few academic interests. However, my background is in applied mathematics, particularly in computational plasma physics. Check out my 1DNumericalPDE repository for that work. I have since transitioned to biomedical engineering focusing on developing predictive models and longitudinal algorithms in medical imaging.
