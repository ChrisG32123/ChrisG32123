## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Chris, and I'm a PhD student in the Computational Mathematics, Science, & Engineering Department at Michigan State University. Welcome to my GitHub!

I have quite a few academic interests. However, my background is in applied mathematics, particularly in computational plasma physics. Check out my 1DNumericalPDE repository for that work. I have since transitioned to biomedical engineering focusing on developing predictive models and longitudinal algorithms in medical imaging (found in the Longitudinal-Data-Algorithm-Development repository). 

Additionally, I have other projects, some from personal passion and others from classes past. The stock-market-analysis repository began as my attempt to find low-rank representations of stock market time series data but quickly turned into an exercise in high performance paralllel computing using C++. The choice_week_sorting_hat repository is based off of solving a logistics problem between allocating students to classes, a problem my former employer (a K-8 school) had to manage manually. Finally, the beaconrunner-CAMCOS repository houses the first project I contributed to, a virtual simulation of various actors using a decentralized blockchain--intended to understand the Ethereum transaction system and its potential faults.

Over the course of Fall 2024, I intend to 'properly' organize and document most of my projects into GitHub--the way that software engineers are expected too.
